# House Price Prediction Using Advanced Regression Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the process of predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques like LASSO and Ridge. The project is structured into data manipulation, model building, and additional models with visualizations.

## Project Structure
- `house_prcies_data_manipulation.ipynb`: Prepares and cleans the housing data for analysis.
- `house_prices_regression_models.ipynb`: Implements basic and advanced regression models including LASSO and Ridge.
- `house_prices_additional_models_visualizations.ipynb`: Explores more models and provides visual insights into the data and model performances.
